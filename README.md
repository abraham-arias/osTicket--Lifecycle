# osTicket — Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution  
This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a help desk ticket in **osTicket**, from initial submission by an end user through agent assignment, communication, escalation, and resolution.

Understanding ticket workflows is essential for roles in **IT Support**, **Help Desk**, **Technical Support**, and **Junior System Administration**, as ticket management is a core daily responsibility.

# 🛠️ Lifecycle Walkthrough (Realistic Scenario)

## 🔹 Stage 1 — Ticket Intake (User Submits Request)

Karen, an end user, submits a ticket reporting a **Business Critical Outage** involving mobile banking.

She selects the appropriate help topic, which was previously configured to categorize high-severity issues.

## 🔹 Stage 2 — Assignment & Initial Communication

Agents monitor live tickets within the **Agent Panel**.

From here:

- Queue managers assign tickets to appropriate departments or agents  
- SLAs can be adjusted  
- Priorities can be changed  
- Notes and communication are added  

Agent **Jane Doe** begins working on Karen's ticket and updates it with a status message.

## 🔹 Stage 3 — Working the Issue  
The ticket is escalated:

- Priority is set to **Emergency**  
- SLA is modified to match severity  
- Ticket assigned to a senior technician  
- Internal communication tracks the status update  

Agents communicate their actions directly inside the ticket for transparency and documentation.

## 🔹 Stage 4 — Resolution & Ticket Closure

After the issue is resolved, the technician closes the ticket.

Closed tickets appear in a separate tab and retain important information such as:

- Date/time of resolution  
- Assigned agent  
- SLA compliance  
- Action history  

This creates an auditable trail for IT management and reporting.
